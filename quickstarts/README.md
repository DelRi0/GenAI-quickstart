## Quickstarts for Unified Data Framework for Gaming

This directory contains quickstarts that allow users to deploy specific parts of the framework. We realize that users may only want to deploy parts of the framework, so we have provided deployment scripts that allow users to configure and deploy specific services.

The deployable sections are identified in the architecture diagram below:
